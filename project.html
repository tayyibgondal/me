    <h1>Best Projects</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>ProtoECGNet:</strong> Designed an interpretable ECG diagnosis model as part of my research internship at the University of Alberta. .</li>
        <li><strong>TorchLite:</strong> My open-source neural network library with a PyTorch-like API, built on top of a scalar-valued autograd engine. Currently supports ANNs only..</li>
        <li><strong>Quickformer - Enhanced Transformer:</strong> Developed a faster transformer model with linear complexity, achieving 8x speed-up in NLP tasks. 
        <li><strong>GPT-2 from Scratch:</strong> Implemented GPT-2 to generate Shakespeare-like text from scratch. 
        <li><strong>EEGFormer:</strong> Built a custom transformer for epilepsy detection, achieving 85% accuracy and 0.71 F1 score. .</li>
        <li><strong>ECG Rhythm Anomaly Detection:</strong> Trained an autoencoder on the ECG5000 dataset, achieving 94% accuracy and 0.90 recall. .</li>
        <li><strong>Biomedical Image Segmentation:</strong> Performed image segmentation using U-Net for biomedical images. .</li>
        <li><strong>Depression Detection via Social Media:</strong> Developed a hierarchical deep learning system to infer depression from social media posts. .</li>
        <li><strong>GAN Architectures from Scratch:</strong> Implemented 6 GAN variants, including DCGAN, CycleGAN, ConditionalGAN, SNGAN, WGAN-GD, and styleGAN. .</li>
        <li><strong>Text Summarization with Transformers:</strong> Compared the performance of GPT, BERT, BART, and other models on text summarization..</li>
        <li><strong>Project Photon:</strong> Built a Google Photos clone using microservices architecture; deployed on Google Cloud. .</li>
        <li><strong>National Open-Courseware:</strong> Built a clone of MIT OpenCourseWare for Pakistani universities to democratize access to higher education for underprivileged students..</li>
