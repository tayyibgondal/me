    <h3>My advice for newcomers at SEECS, or NUST in general: Should you worry about getting good grades? What if MOST of the peers keep telling you they don't care about grades or gpa? How would you react? </h3>
</header>

<article>

    <p>Since i joined nust (till now as i am in my last semester),  most of my friends have kept saying that they don't care about gpa or good grades. And initially, it always sent me in dilemma. Should i spend time on course work? or should i spend it doing something else useful? When most of the peers around you say that they don't really care about grades, it most probably has negative contagious effect and as a result, spending time on coursework can feel as if you are wasting your time. Because i don't want you to listen to noise when you join university and affect your performance, i am writing this article. I would try to categorize different opinions/types of peers you'll find, and would share my opinion on who should you listen to.
        <br>
 Your friend circle or close peers can really affect your approach towards getting good grades and the amount of hard work you put into the courses during your time at university. It’s very important to be ‘aware’ of the different types of opinions or attitudes you’ll find in university, so you don’t get off-track due to opinions which you weren't expecting.</p>
    <p>There are two main categories of students in this matter: those who say they care about their GPA, and those who say they don’t. But when you look closer, you’ll find that each of these groups can be divided into even more specific types of people. Let’s take a closer look at each one, so you can better understand the environment you’re stepping into.</p>
    <center><img src="../images/blogs/freshmen.png" style="width: 80%; height: auto;"></center>

    <h2>1. Those Who Say They Care About GPA</h2>
    <p>Students who claim they care about their GPA often fall into two distinct categories. Some are driven by a deep sense of ambition, while others might take their obsession with grades to unhealthy extremes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>a. Desperate People</strong>
            <p>These are the students who can be spotted from a distance due to their intense focus on achieving perfect grades. While it’s great to aim high, these individuals go a bit overboard with their efforts. They tend to push their priorities too far and may sacrifice friendships or social interactions just to get better grades. Their GPA is their life, and they devote every ounce of energy to securing the highest marks possible.</p>
            <p>What’s interesting (and sometimes concerning) about this group is their approach when grades come out. If their performance doesn’t meet their expectations, they might show up at paper showings or meetings with professors, aggressively fighting for marks. They behave as though they are begging for higher grades, which can sometimes create an uncomfortable environment for everyone involved. The desperation often stems from an unhealthy obsession with GPA, and it can lead to stress, anxiety, and strained relationships with peers and faculty.</p>
        <p>DON'T BE ONE OF THEM.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>b. Honest People</strong>
            <p>In contrast, there’s another group of students who also care about their GPA but maintain a more balanced, respectful approach. These individuals are clear about their academic goals and are vocal about their desire to do well. If you are attending university, paying a certain fees, and spending dedicate time/years of your life, then you should never be ashamed of sticking to what you think is right and that you should pursue it.</p>
            <p>If people of this category believe they were graded unfairly or their performance doesn't reflect their true efforts, they will approach their professors in a polite and respectful manner only to (most probably) request feedback to understand how they could do better. <br><br> TAKING FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT, AND YOU SHOULD ALWAYS REACH OUT TO PROFESSORS AND ASK THEM WHAT EXACTLY YOU DID WRONG IN EXAMS, AND HOW YOU COULD IMPROVE UPON IT.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Those Who Say They Don’t Care About GPA</h2>
    <p>On the flip side, there are students who claim they don't care about their GPA. While it might sound like they’ve are 'cool', the reality is a bit more complex. This group can also be divided into two subgroups: those who pretend not to care, and those who genuinely don’t.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>a. Pretenders</strong>
            <p>Pretenders are students who say they don’t care about their GPA, but in truth, they care just as much as the students who claim they do. These individuals put on a mask of indifference, telling others they’re not worried about grades, but behind the scenes, they are working just as hard (if not harder) than anyone else. You’ll often see them stressing over bad grades (you can tell from their faces), or doing labs/assignments in time etc.</p>
            <p>What gives them away is their behavior at paper showings or when grades are posted. They would almost always show up at paper showings, and mostly would be reviewing their exams, even though they’ve told everyone that grades aren’t important to them. They might spend hours cramming for subjects that require memorization, even though they’ve repeatedly claimed they don’t care about their GPA. Why don’t they spend this time which they are spending while coming to paper showings/cramming useless slides, doing what they truly care about?</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>b. Genuine People</strong>
            <p>Then there are those who genuinely don’t care about their GPA, and it’s not just a statement—they live by it. While most students might get caught up in chasing grades, these individuals are more interested in developing their technical skills, earning bucks, gaining practical experience, or pursuing personal projects that align with their long-term goals. They may even choose to study things outside of the typical curriculum that better suit their interests, like learning new programming languages, working on side projects, or building a portfolio that will help them in their future careers.</p>
            <p>Unlike the pretenders, these students don’t spend excessive time stressing over their grades or cramming for exams. They prioritize learning and personal growth over numbers on a paper. 
            <br>
        <br>
                BUT the DOWNSIDE is that most of the times, if not all, they would have a poor GPA. One of the easiest ways of going to the West (Canada, USA, Europe etc.) for exposure is to get admitted to some graduate program. And these people would most probably miss on this opportunity (unless they are super rich and paying for their tuition without availing a scholarship).</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Summary/My Advice to the Newcomers: 
        <li>
            CARE ABOUT YOUR GRADES, BE VOCAL ABOUT IT WITHOUT BEING ASHAMED, AND DON’T BE DESPERATE. 
        </li>
       <li>BEWARE OF THE PRETENDERS, AND DON'T GET DEMOTIVATED OR LESS HARDWORKING DUE TO THEIR FACADE TOWARDS GRADES. IGNORE THIS NOISE.</li></h2>
