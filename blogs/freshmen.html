          <h1>Advice for Newcomers at NUST</h1>
          <p class="lead">Should you worry about grades? What if most of your peers say they do not? Should you go to paper showings and talk to professors?</p>
        </header>

        <p>
          Since I joined NUST (and even now in my last semester), most people I met kept saying they don't care about grades or GPA.
          When you hear that repeatedly, it's easy to feel guilty for caring. I certainly felt that. This note is for anyone sitting in
          the same dilemma, wondering if coursework time is "wasted" time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we go further, keep in mind that almost everyone cares about their grades. They just express it differently. Broadly,
          there are two camps: people who say they care, and people who say they don't.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Those who say they care about grades</h2>
        <p>Even within this camp you will meet two very different energies.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>a. Desperate people</strong><br>
            They can be spotted from a distance because grades are their entire identity. They might overdo things, sacrifice friendships,
            and push priorities so far that everything becomes a competition. When grades are released, they're ready to argue, beg, or
            bargain for marks. Please don't be one of them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>b. Honest people</strong><br>
            These folks care deeply about their grades but in a balanced way. They are vocal about their goals, never ashamed of wanting
            to do well, and when results don't match effort they politely ask professors for feedback. They visit paper showings not to beg
            for marks but to learn how to improve. If someone mocks you for taking feedback seriously, ignore the noise — you're investing
            in your learning.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Those who say they don't care about grades</h2>
        <p>Again, two patterns tend to emerge.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>a. Pretenders</strong><br>
            They claim they don't care but actually do. They still show up at paper showings, cram for memorization-heavy courses, and the
            stress shows on their faces. Ask why they spend so much time reviewing papers if they truly don't care — you'll rarely get a
            convincing answer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>b. Genuine people</strong><br>
            A smaller group genuinely prioritizes skills, jobs, and personal projects over numbers. They might happily trade GPAs for
            internships, freelancing, or startups. That's valid, but note the trade-off: a low GPA can close doors to scholarships and grad
            school pathways abroad unless you can self-fund.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My advice</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Care about your grades, say it out loud, and don't apologize for it.</li>
          <li>Beware of pretenders — don't let their façade dilute your effort.</li>
          <li>Always attend paper showings to seek feedback, not to negotiate marks.</li>
        </ul>
