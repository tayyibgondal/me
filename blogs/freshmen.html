    <h3>My advice for newcomers at SEECS, or NUST in general: Should you worry about getting good grades? What if some people keep telling you they don't care? How would you react? </h3>

<article>

    <p>As a newcomer at NUST, one of the first things you'll encounter is the wide variety of students who have different approaches to their grades, particularly their GPA. Your friend circle or close peers can really affect your approach and the amount of hard work you put into the courses during your time at university. It’s very important to be ‘aware’ of the different types of opinions or attitudes you’ll find, so you don’t get off-track.</p>
    <p>Broadly, there are two main categories of students: those who say they care about their GPA, and those who say they don’t. But when you look closer, you’ll find that each of these groups can be divided into even more specific types of people. Let’s take a closer look at each one, so you can better understand the environment you’re stepping into.</p>
    <center><img src="../images/blogs/freshmen.png" style="width: 80%; height: auto;"></center>

    <h2>1. Those Who Say They Care About GPA</h2>
    <p>Students who claim they care about their GPA often fall into two distinct categories. Some are driven by a deep sense of ambition, while others might take their obsession with grades to unhealthy extremes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>a. Desperate People</strong>
            <p>These are the students who can be spotted from a distance due to their intense focus on achieving perfect grades. While it’s great to aim high, these individuals go a bit overboard with their efforts. They tend to push their priorities too far and may sacrifice friendships or social interactions just to get better grades. Their GPA is their life, and they devote every ounce of energy to securing the highest marks possible.</p>
            <p>What’s interesting (and sometimes concerning) about this group is their approach when grades come out. If their performance doesn’t meet their expectations, they might show up at paper showings or meetings with professors, aggressively fighting for marks. They behave as though they are begging for higher grades, which can sometimes create an uncomfortable environment for everyone involved. The desperation often stems from an unhealthy obsession with GPA, and it can lead to stress, anxiety, and strained relationships with peers and faculty.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>b. Honest People</strong>
            <p>In contrast, there’s another group of students who also care about their GPA but maintain a more balanced, respectful approach. These individuals are clear about their academic goals and are vocal about their desire to do well. They understand the importance of grades but don’t let their pursuit of academic success take over their lives.</p>
            <p>If they believe they were graded unfairly or their performance doesn't reflect their true efforts, they will approach their professors in a polite and respectful manner. They will discuss their grades and request feedback to understand what they could do better, but if the professor decides not to adjust their grade, they accept it gracefully and move on. This group is more focused on improvement and personal growth than simply aiming for a perfect GPA. They want to better themselves as students, not just boost a number on a transcript.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Those Who Say They Don’t Care About GPA</h2>
    <p>On the flip side, there are students who claim they don't care about their GPA. While it might sound like they’ve found a more relaxed approach to university life, the reality is a bit more complex. This group can also be divided into two subgroups: those who pretend not to care, and those who genuinely don’t.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>a. Pretenders</strong>
            <p>Pretenders are students who say they don’t care about their GPA, but in truth, they care just as much as the students who claim they do. These individuals put on a mask of indifference, telling others they’re not worried about grades, but behind the scenes, they are working just as hard (if not harder) than anyone else. You’ll often see them stressing over assignments, etc.</p>
            <p>What gives them away is their behavior at paper showings or when grades are posted. They would almost always show up at paper showings, and mostly would be reviewing their exams to see if their marks can be increased, even though they’ve told everyone that grades aren’t important to them. They might spend hours cramming for subjects that require memorization, even though they’ve repeatedly claimed they don’t care about their GPA. Why don’t they spend this time doing what they truly care about?</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>b. Genuine People</strong>
            <p>Then there are those who genuinely don’t care about their GPA, and it’s not just a statement—they live by it. These students often have a completely different focus. While most students might get caught up in chasing grades, these individuals are more interested in developing their technical skills, gaining practical experience, or pursuing personal projects that align with their long-term goals. They may even choose to study things outside of the typical curriculum that better suit their interests, like learning new programming languages, working on side projects, or building a portfolio that will help them in their future careers.</p>
            <p>Unlike the pretenders, these students don’t spend excessive time stressing over their grades or cramming for exams. They prioritize learning and personal growth over numbers on a paper. But the downside is that most, if not all, of the time, they would have a poor GPA. One of the easiest ways of going to the West (Canada, USA, Europe) for exposure is to get admission into some graduate program. And these types of people would most probably miss this opportunity (unless they are paying for their tuition and not on a scholarship).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
